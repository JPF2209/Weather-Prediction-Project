# SIT210-Weather-Prediction-Project

For this project, if you don't want to do the data collection stages of the project, all the files that you need to use is the ML.py, flows(6).json and all the hours(x).txt files as well since the json file opens up the node-red link, the ML.py file runs the prediction algorithm and the hours(x).txt files have all the data recorded split in hourly blocks.
